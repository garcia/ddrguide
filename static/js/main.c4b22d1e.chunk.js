Worry not! While the user interface may seem complicated at first glance, it won't take long to figure out the basics. And remember that if you ever get stuck, you can always ask a regular player for help; arcade DDR is a social experience above all else.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that said, a little prior knowledge goes a long way for confidence. This guide covers the complete flow for playing DDR, from the moment you swipe your card to the end of your session.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### In a Nutshell\\r\\n> Bring your game card to the arcade (or buy one there), plus your e-amusement card. Respect anyone who's playing or waiting for their turn on the game. Put in your credits, then scan your e-amusement card and enter your PIN. Select \\\"Premium Play\\\" when prompted. When you find a song you want to play, press \\\"9\\\" on the number pad to set your options (mainly speed) and enjoy the game!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Prerequisites\\r\\n\\r\\nThis guide assumes you've already found an arcade that offers DDR A or A20.  In North America, this will likely be a [glossary:Round1] or [glossary:Dave & Buster's] location, as these are the two chains that offer modern DDR mixes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should have a game card for that *specific location* - game credits typically don't work at other arcade locations, even within the same chain. If you want to transfer your game credits from another location in the same chain, you can ask at the front desk and they'll help you out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdeally, you should have an [glossary:e-amusement] pass too. This card will enable [glossary:Premium Play], track your scores, and grant you access to unlockable songs & in-game events. If you don't have one, you might be able to purchase one from the arcade's front desk for around $5, although many locations are out of stock for the foreseeable future. You can also purchase e-amusement cards online, typically secondhand through eBay or Facebook buy/sell groups, for $10-20 a piece. If all else fails, you can still play DDR without an e-amusement pass, although I would recommend finding one as soon as possible for the best gameplay experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your game card and e-amusement pass in hand, you're ready to step up to the dancing stage!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Starting the game\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you find the DDR cabinet, first **check whether anyone is playing** or waiting to play. If people are actively playing, or if the game doesn't appear to be in the \\\"attract sequence\\\" (the default mode when no one is playing), you'll need to wait your turn. There might be a [glossary:card line] if multiple players are waiting for their turn, in which case you should ask a player (but not while they're dancing!) where to put your card. If there's no card line on the cabinet marquee or screen frame, look around for any other potential players hovering near the DDR cabinet. If you're not sure, just ask if they're waiting to play; again, the arcade DDR experience is a social one. Talking to fellow players is good!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf no one else is playing or waiting to play, go ahead and **swipe / tap your game card** using the arcade's card reader, usually somewhere below the screen. You should hear a sound effect when the game accepts your credit. If you're playing with a friend, you'll need *two credits* to play together. If you have an e-amusement pass, swipe it by the NFC card reader on the cabinet, next to the buttons; without an e-amusement pass, just press the green button to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn DDR A20, the game will prompt you to choose a language. The choice defaults to English on [glossary:white cabinets|white cabinet] and Japanese on [glossary:gold cabinets|gold cabinet], so take a moment to check the selection before pressing the green button to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the cabinet is connected to the Internet, you'll be prompted to scan your e-amusement card. If this is your first time using your card, the game will guide you through basic profile creation; follow the instructions on-screen to set your name and region. Otherwise, you'll be prompted to **enter your PIN** on the number pad next to the NFC card reader. Once logged in, press the green button to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### Tip\\r\\n> If you make a mistake while typing your PIN, you can press any arrow button (left/right/up/down) to clear your entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, the game will prompt you to **choose a game mode**. If you're playing alongside another player, the game will automatically select Versus Mode; otherwise, you can choose [glossary:Single|SP], [glossary:Double|DP], or Versus using the left/right buttons and pressing the green button to confirm. (I recommend choosing Single if you're new). Finally, if you used an e-amusement pass, the game will ask you to choose whether to play with Premium Play or not. You should **always choose Premium Play**; it's free at all established North America locations! Simply press the down button to select Premium Play and press green to confirm.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Premium Play|/images/Article - navigating-the-ddr-ui - Premium Play.jpg]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you know what you're doing, this whole process should only take about 15 seconds each time. Now you're ready to choose your first song and play the game!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Song selection & Gameplay\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the music selection screen, you can use all four arrow buttons to navigate the song list. Hold left or right to scan through the complete list of songs, or hold up or down to scroll through each row of 3 songs faster. You can also press and hold up and down to leave a song folder immediately, or press and hold left and right to choose another sort mode. Need help choosing a song? Check out our guide on [article:deciding what to play] for some useful advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you find a song you like, press the green button to play it; be aware that there's no backing out once you've chosen a song! If you *hold* the green button, it'll take you to the [glossary:Option] menu where you can set your speed and more. (If you just want to set your options *without* choosing a song, press the \\\"9\\\" key on the number pad before using the green button). Select your preferred difficulty using the up/down buttons; a lower number ([glossary:level]) indicates an easier chart. If you're ready to play, press the green button again (without holding it down) to confirm. If you're playing with another player, they'll need to confirm too before the song starts.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Option Menu|/images/Article - navigating-the-ddr-ui - Option Menu.jpg]\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### Tip\\r\\n> Once you're comfortable with the game, it becomes crucial to **update your speed option** before every song. Check out our guide on [article:setting your speed] for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\nGet ready to dance now! You'll have a moment before the first arrow appears on the screen to adjust your footing. If you need help understanding the scrolling arrows, check out our article on [article:basic gameplay] for an in-depth explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you complete the song, you'll be presented with a results screen that shows your [glossary:score], your [glossary:grade], and more details below. You can use the left/right buttons to switch between some tabs that show different details. It's a lot of information to take in, so don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're new to DDR, here are some basic goals to aim for:\\r\\n\\r\\n* First, just try to [glossary:clear] songs. If you received a [glossary:grade] of D or higher, you know you cleared it!\\r\\n* Next, try to get as few [glossary:misses|miss] as possible. You can see your miss count at the bottom of the judgement breakdown, which you may need to find by pressing the left/right buttons to switch tabs.\\r\\n* Once you're feeling comfortable hitting the arrows, try concentrating on hitting them as close to the beat as possible. This will yield higher scores and better grades! You can verify your progress from the judgement breakdown tab; you want to hit more notes with higher judgements, like [glossary:Marvelous], and fewer notes with lower judgements, like [glossary:Good].\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### Tip\\r\\n> If you're proud of your score, snap a photo! You can post it online, or just save it to document your progress; it's your call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you used your e-amusement card at the start (granting access to [glossary:Premium Play]), you'll always get to play 3 stages per game, so pick whatever you want for each stage! Without an e-amusement card, you can only progress if you cleared each song, so you may want to save harder picks for the last stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Extra Stage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [glossary:Extra Stage] is only accessible on Premium Play, so you'll need an e-amusement pass if you're interested in this game mechanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you clear your final stage, the game may take you to the Extra Stage, where you can play new & unlockable songs! However, your [glossary:life gauge] is forced onto [glossary:LIFE4]: four misses will end the stage immediately. Keep this in mind when choosing what song / chart to play.\\r\\n\\r\\n* If you're interested in playing the latest content, check out the \\\"Extra Exclusive\\\" folder for some new music that can *only* be played on the Extra Stage.\\r\\n* If you're interested in unlocking new songs to play anytime, check out the event folders *below* \\\"Extra Exclusive\\\" for unlockable songs.\\r\\n* If you just want to keep playing, go ahead and pick another sort option to find all the standard songs. Remember that you're still locked onto the LIFE4 gauge, whether you play a song that's exclusive to the Extra Stage or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy clearing an unlockable song, you immediately unlock all the charts up to the one you cleared for normal play. If you failed, don't worry! However far you made it into the song will be counted as progress towards unlocking it; if you can make it, say, *halfway* through the chart, playing it *twice* will unlock it for normal play, where you can play it on the normal life gauge.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Ending the game\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter your last stage, the game will show you an overview of the scores you got, followed by a logout screen that shows your card info and (on DDR A only) your [glossary:result stars|result star]. You can usually ignore the contents of these screens and press the green button to dismiss them; this is the recommended course of action if other players are waiting for their turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's up to you whether to keep playing, or for how many games in total. Sessions vary wildly in length among established DDR players; some are content to play for an hour or two, while others will stay for 6+ hour grinding sessions. Don't feel obligated to continue if you're worn out, physically or mentally - but if you're determined to improve, pushing your limits can be a great way to build stamina! Know your goals and use them to decide how to play the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further reading\\r\\n\\r\\nOne aspect of the UI often overlooked by beginners is the option menu, which is mainly used for [setting your speed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're 100% brand-new to the game, you'll probably want to read about [basic gameplay] as well.\"}")},50:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"data":{"title":"Setting your Speed Option","slug":"setting-your-speed","description":"Finding the right multiplier for the song, plus some gotchas to look out for.","sections":["Understanding speed","Finding your target BPM","Speed in practice","Dealing with strange BPMs"]},"content":"Of all the settings you can change from the Option menu, speed is the most important *and* the most heavily dependent on the song. Most players will set or verify their speed choice before every stage, as the penalty for leaving it on the wrong choice can range from getting a lower [glossary:score] to outright [glossary:failing|fail] the song. In this article we\'ll discuss how the speed mod affects gameplay, how to choose your speed for each song, and some important caveats for specific songs.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### In A Nutshell\\r\\n> On DanceDanceRevolution A / A20, press the \\"9\\" key on the music selection screen to access the Option menu. Set your speed *lower* for songs with a *greater* maximum BPM and vice-versa. The BPM times your speed multiplier should be somewhere between 250 and 600, wherever you feel comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Understanding speed\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re not familiar with the concept, *speed* in rhythm games determines the rate at which the [glossary:notes|note] scroll vertically across the screen. Speed doesn\'t affect the density of notes over time - that is, you won\'t have to *move* faster to hit the notes - the effect it has is purely visual. Higher speed means that the notes will scroll faster and be more spaced apart, which aids readability, especially in densely packed charts. However, higher speed also means that you have less time to react to the notes, since they take less time to scroll from the edge of the screen to the [glossary:receptors]. Finding the right speed is all about finding a balance between its positives and negatives - ideally, you should give yourself just enough time to comfortably react to the notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn DanceDanceRevolution, your choice of speed acts as a multiplier for the song\'s base speed, which is determined by its tempo. In practice, this means that songs with a higher tempo (i.e. a greater BPM) naturally scroll faster than songs with a lower tempo. For this reason, faster songs in DDR require a lower speed multiplier than slower songs in order to read the notes comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### Trivia\\r\\n> Many rhythm games have since eliminated the concept of a \\"base speed\\", so that the speed multiplier doesn\'t have to be changed for each song. DanceDanceRevolution, being one of the first ever vertically-scrolling rhythm game series (having debuted in 1998), offers its players no such respite.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Finding your target BPM\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formula for scroll speed is relatively simple: take the BPM of the song and multiply it by your speed option. For example, a 140 BPM song being played on x2.0 speed has an *effective speed* of 280. If you\'re brand-new to DDR, your first task should be to determine what effective speed works best for you. Start out slow - no higher than x2.0 for your first few songs - and raise your speed by small increments until you\'re comfortable reading and executing the charts. You should be able to distinguish rhythms and consecutive notes easily, but shouldn\'t feel rushed to hit each note. Feel free to reduce your speed if you need more time to react.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost new players can read effective speeds of 250-300 with no trouble. As you push into more difficult charts, you may find that this is too slow to distinguish densely-packed clusters of notes. Try raising your speed when this happens! High-level players tend to read [glossary:Expert] / [glossary:Challenge] charts at speeds closer to 600.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Speed in practice\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s say you\'re at the arcade, in the middle of a DDR session, and you\'ve found a song you want to play. You\'ve already figured out your preferred target BPM - let\'s say it\'s **400**, for example. Here\'s what to do:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Check the song\'s BPM. This is in a fixed place near the top-center of the screen, next to the song\'s artwork and below the title and artist. Let\'s say the BPM is **180** in this example.\\r\\n* Either do some mental math or pull out your phone\'s calculator to divide your target BPM by the song\'s BPM - for example, **400** divided by **180**. \\r\\n* Round up or down to the nearest available speed option, since the result will probably be a fraction that you can\'t choose directly. In our example, 400/180 is about 2.22, which makes **x2.25** a solid choice (or perhaps **x2.0** if you want to aim slower).\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, enter the option menu by pressing \\"9\\" on the cabinet\'s number pad and use the left/right buttons to adjust your speed. You can dismiss the option menu by pressing \\"9\\" again, or by holding the green or down button until the last option has been passed. Alternatively, you can enter the option menu by holding the green button, but keep in mind that doing this also selects the song, with no way to back out! If you want more information on how to navigate the DanceDanceRevolution UI, [we have an article for that|navigating-the-ddr-ui].\\r\\n\\r\\nThis covers the majority of songs in DDR - those that have just one BPM. However, things aren\'t always so simple in DDR...\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dealing with strange BPMs\\r\\n\\r\\nSome songs incorporate [glossary:BPM changes|BPM change], timed events in the song where the scrolling rate increases or decreases. Since there\'s no option to \\"flatten\\" these speed changes, DDR players must compromise in order to read the chart comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### Trivia\\r\\n> Some rhythm games do have an option to \\"flatten\\" these speed changes. This is known in StepMania and In The Groove as *C-Mod*, meaning a *constant* speed modifier. Whether it\'s acceptable or not depends entirely on the context; for casual play it\'s generally not frowned upon, but it may be prohibited in some tournaments, possibly on specific songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSongs with BPM changes will display a BPM range on the music selection screen - typically the slowest and fastest BPMs in the chart. The first rule-of-thumb is to **set your speed modifier for the faster BPM**, as this ensures you will always have enough time to react to the notes. With this strategy, you opt to compromise on readability during the slower sections. The alternative (setting speed according to the slower BPM) would instead compromise on reaction time during the faster sections, which is strongly discouraged unless you know what you\'re doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some outliers to these rules, especially with boss songs. Here are a few examples:\\r\\n\\r\\n* [song:Go For The Top] displays a BPM of 74-180, but there is actually a brief 400+ BPM section in the middle. This section technically contains no notes, but it *ends* with a note that you will have far less time to react to than the rest of the chart.\\r\\n* Many songs with \\"EVOLVED\\" in the title have an incorrect BPM displayed; some claim to have a constant BPM despite featuring speed changes,  while others show a BPM range that doesn\'t match the chart.\\r\\n* Some songs may display a glitchy animated sequence of random numbers in the BPM field, particularly those in the [glossary:Extra Exclusive] folder. This has no bearing on the nature of the song\'s tempo; it\'s just hidden from public view.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re ever uncertain, refer to **[truebpm.dance|https://truebpm.dance]** for detailed information on the song\'s actual speed. This is a great resource to keep bookmarked on your phone for reference purposes!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further reading\\r\\n\\r\\nTo learn more about the options you can set in DDR, check the glossary entry for the [glossary:option menu|option], as well as the [glossary:speed] entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor another strategy players use to deal with BPM changes, check out the [glossary:SUDDEN+] option."}')},51:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"data":{"title":"Why Play DDR?","slug":"why-play-ddr","description":"Everyone has a different motivation to play. Let\'s figure out yours!","sections":["Exercise","Having fun","The thrill of improving","Social benefits","Further reading"]},"content":"All around the world, thousands of people play DanceDanceRevolution every day. Some are casual arcade-goers trying something new; others are returning players looking to improve their skills; others yet are seasoned veterans grinding for the highest scores. The fact of the matter is that every one of these people has a different reason for playing. No single source of motivation could possibly draw this many people to a single game. In this article, we\'ll look at the various reasons why people choose to play DanceDanceRevolution. Maybe one or two of them will resonate with you!\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### In a Nutshell\\r\\n> Besides being a fun videogame, DDR is a great source of exercise, has a banging soundtrack, offers near-endless opportunities for self-improvement, and comes with a devoted community of players who love to see new faces at the arcade. Give it a shot!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Exercise\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should come as no surprise that a game where you move your legs constantly can be a good source of exercise. One of the best aspects of this source of motivation is that it applies to everyone, regardless of skill level. While it might seem like the return on investment would increase as you progress into the harder difficulties, much of that progression is driven by optimizing your *form* - conserving energy to hit more arrows without burning out. As a new player, you\'ll naturally burn more calories on each step at the start of your journey!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be noted that DDR isn\'t a replacement for a full exercise regimen. The closest comparison to traditional exercise routines would be *high-intensity interval training*, a form of cardio workout. Nonetheless, it\'s a great source of exercise with plenty of well-documented health benefits. DDR has been used in schools and fitness centers to promote exercise for children, and it\'s even helped one player with cardiovascular problems [lose 125 pounds|https://kotaku.com/dance-dance-revolution-helps-man-lose-125-pounds-1829484016]. DDR can be a great way to augment an existing fitness routine - or, if you don\'t have a routine outside of DDR (as is common among players), it\'s a *vast* improvement over doing nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Having fun\\r\\n\\r\\nTurns out you can play videogames to have fun! Crazy, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly what makes DDR fun to play is something that varies from player to player almost as much as the very sources of motivation we\'re already discussing. Maybe you enjoy listening to the energetic soundtrack, or the thrill of *finally* comboing that one song, or going head-to-head in Versus mode with your friends. Maybe it\'s the unlockable song events that appeal to you, or just the mental space of focusing on one very simple task for a few minutes, leaving all your worries behind for the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack in particular deserves more than a passing mention - the music of DDR is highly varied, spanning the [classic high-speed dance sound|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRfOTl8MREo] that older DDR [glossary:mixes|mix] were known for to [modern bangers|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejz9ZwNfhu8] for the current era of the game. Get your daily exercise while listening to eccentric, memorable songs like [SAKURA|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3Uz6uBOwjw] or [Dazzlin\' Darlin\'|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQh8svG-HY0] or even [MAX 300|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-Dpr3Cri8]! There are 800 songs in the latest version of the game, so you\'re sure to find something you\'ll vibe with.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a lot of players find it fun just to *get better at the game* over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The thrill of improving\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising your scores, clearing harder songs, and comboing what once seemed impossible to combo are all valid sources of dopamine. Further, playing with the deliberate goal of getting better can grant your sessions structure and purpose - rather than aimlessly playing whatever sounds fun, try aiming for specific goals like clearing every song in a folder, working up to harder levels, or attaining full combos on your favorite songs! For more detailed advice along these lines, check out our article on [deciding what to play].\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe you\'ve watched videos of high-level players obtaining seemingly impossible scores on ridiculously hard charts. Though it may be hard to believe, *you, too* can reach this level of skill with enough determination! It takes years of practice and a will to consciously improve at the game, but these aren\'t traits that anyone is born with or without. All of the best players started from the same place as you; if you\'re able and willing to put in the work, you can join them at the top! This particular motivation requires a lot of investment up-front, but the payoff can exceed your wildest dreams if you follow through.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Social benefits\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s something magical about a videogame that requires you to get out of your home to play. While DDR has had home console releases in the past, right now most players are hitting their local arcades ([glossary:Dave & Buster\'s] and [glossary:ROUND1]) for the latest DDR [glossary:mixes|mix]. This means that you\'ll be interacting with other regular players, and often playing alongside them (it\'s more time-efficient for two players to dance together than to take single-player turns). It\'s a great way to make friends who automatically have one interest in common - and often more!\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides meeting your fellow arcade-goers, lots of players talk about DDR on social media. You can find players from all around the world, at every skill level, who are looking for people to chat with on Twitter, in Facebook groups, and elsewhere online. Come join the conversation, if you\'re interested! The DDR community is overwhelmingly supportive of new players, and posting your achievements online can be a good source of positive feedback from players all around you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter you\'ve honed your dance game skills for awhile, you might even gain interest in attending DDR tournaments. You don\'t need to be the best of the best to participate - many tournaments have lower divisions, and even in the absence of those, DDR tournaments are generally arranged to match evenly-skilled players at the start. Tournaments are where you\'ll get to meet the players you\'ve talked with online, and maybe even make some more friends. Actually playing in the tournament is just a nice bonus perk for those who attend.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further reading\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article goes hand-in-hand with [deciding what to play], which discusses possible motivations for playing specific songs."}')},52:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse("{\"data\":{\"title\":\"Basic Gameplay\",\"slug\":\"basic-gameplay\",\"description\":\"Learn the fundamentals of playing DDR - how to read the screen and where to put your feet.\",\"sections\":[\"Positioning yourself\",\"Bar or no bar?\",\"Reading the screen\",\"Basic techniques\",\"Correcting mistakes\",\"Further reading\"]},\"content\":\"For every piece of trivia that I consider to be \\\"common knowledge\\\", thousands to tens of thousands of people will learn about it for the first time each and every day. It's just how [the numbers|https://xkcd.com/1053/] work out. And while DanceDanceRevolution gameplay is perhaps *slightly* more niche than your average piece of common knowledge, it's still undeniably part of the Internet's collective consciousness. It's embedded in GIFs and [viral YouTube videos|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFlCD_IaTE8] and the odd [movie|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qatmvE7S4Sw] or two. Regardless of how much you already know about DDR, this article aims to get you up to speed: where to put your feet, how to read the screen, and some basic techniques that you can try out at the arcade.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### In a Nutshell\\r\\n> Place your feet on the left and right arrows. You can hold the bar with your hands to make things easier. Try to alternate left and right feet to hit the arrows as they scroll onto the receptors, and don't be afraid to cross your left leg over your right (or vice-versa). Above all else, practice!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Positioning yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's say you're about to start your first song - if you need help reaching this point, check out our article on [navigating the DDR UI]. First, make sure you're standing on the correct side of the [glossary:dance stage]; if you started the game using the buttons on the left, then stand on the left set of four panels. You should see the four [glossary:receptors] on the corresponding side of the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere should you put your feet? Intuition might tell you to place them in the center, on the metal panel between the four arrows. Most players would recommend that you **put your feet on the left and right arrows** instead - your feet will never need to move onto that center panel anyway! You don't need to plant your feet dead-center on the arrow panels; each [glossary:panel] has four sensors, one on each edge, meaning that you're free to hit the panels on any side. This is one of the most basic principles of *energy conservation* - a crucial concept once you start playing the harder [glossary:difficulties|difficulty]. It takes less energy to keep your feet relatively close to the middle than it does to move them all the way to each panel's center.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bar or no bar?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you know where to put your legs, it's time to talk about your arms. Behind the [glossary:dance stage], each set of four panels has its own metal bar, roughly at waist level (depending on your height). Feel free to **hold onto the bar** during gameplay; this will make it easier to maintain your center of gravity as you move around. Every player holds the bar slightly differently, so don't worry too much about holding it the \\\"right\\\" way - just find a position that's comfortable on your hands and arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have heard of players who play \\\"no bar\\\", or even been told that playing without the bar is the \\\"correct\\\" way to play. In modern times, the vast majority of the DDR community has put this debate to rest: *there's no shame in holding the bar*, and players who insist otherwise are woefully stuck in the past. That said, if no-bar play sounds appealing to you, try it out! Some players stick with it for life; others practice it occasionally for fun, or for building endurance. It makes the game significantly more challenging at the higher levels, but nailing the no-bar form is a gratifying experience all of its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reading the screen\\r\\n\\r\\nYour arms and legs are in position, and now it's time to actually play the game. Before the arrows show up on-screen, take a moment to internalize the rhythm of the [glossary:song]; most songs in DDR play a few seconds of audio before the first note. Maybe tap your foot to the beat, or just watch the flashes of the [glossary:receptors] at the top of the screen; on the lower difficulties, most notes will coincide exactly with these beats.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when a scrolling arrow overlaps completely with its receptor, step on the corresponding panel. Repeat this process until the song is over. You're done!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, mostly. You still have to decide *which foot* to use to hit each note. The most basic rule is to use your left foot to hit left arrows, your right foot to hit right arrows, and whichever foot is more convenient at the moment for up and down arrows. This rule ensures that you'll always be able to face the screen without having to turn your body significantly. A slightly more robust rule is to **alternate using your left and right feet** for each note. [glossary:Charts|chart] aren't random, and most of the time, they're written to cater to this very common play style. Alternating left and right steps balances your exertion across the two halves of your body, minimizes the amount of movement required, and just *feels* natural. (Of course, if you have to hit two of the *same* arrow in a row - say, two consecutive left arrows - then go ahead and use the same foot twice.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, DDR would be a pretty boring game if this were the end of the story, so let's talk about some slightly more advanced techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic techniques\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen two scrolling arrows appear on the same row, it's called a [glossary:jump]. You want to step *onto* both panels on the beat, not *jump off of* them - this is a common mistake among casual arcade-goers. You don't need to jump particularly high; putting too much energy into it will wear you out way quicker than everything else. You do need to hit both panels reasonably close in time to each other, so trying to hit the two arrows in rapid succession probably won't work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome arrows have a long vertical \\\"tail\\\" after them; these are [glossary:freeze notes|freeze note]. Hit the arrow normally, then keep your foot on that panel at least until the end of the tail has passed. You don't need to lift your foot off of the panel when the freeze note ends. The game will give you some leniency if you briefly release the freeze note, say, to reposition your foot, but only for a fraction of a second, so don't rely on that leniency too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you're holding a freeze note, there might be other arrows you have to hit. You'll need to use your other foot to hit these, regardless of which panel they're on; this is a case where the \\\"alternating feet\\\" rule no longer applies. If you're worried about losing your balance during these patterns, remember that you can hold onto the bar to keep your center of gravity steady.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of \\\"alternating feet\\\", you will eventually encounter patterns where strictly alternating your feet would force you to hit the right arrow with your left foot, or the left arrow with your right foot. What should you do in this case? You have two options: you could [glossary:double-step], breaking the rule in order to hit the left/right arrow with the closer foot. Alternatively, you could keep alternating your feet regardless, which is known as a [glossary:crossover]. Crossovers are very common in DDR, and it's generally recommended to **learn how to crossover** sooner rather than later. It might feel a little unnatural at first, but it's one of the gameplay mechanics that makes DDR so *interesting* to play and watch. Give them a try!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Correcting mistakes\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's no doubt that you'll make mistakes your first time on the dance stage. Resolving these mistakes is usually just a matter of **practice**; don't try to memorize step sequences for specific songs! Most mistakes fall into one of three categories: *spatial accuracy* (hitting the correct arrow panel), *temporal accuracy* (hitting notes on the right beat), and *temporal precision* (hitting notes **on** the beat, colloquially known as \\\"timing\\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find yourself hitting the wrong panel by mistake (spatial accuracy), there's not much to do other than to practice. Reading the notes on-screen is like reading a new language; you shouldn't need to look down at the panels any more than you need to refer to the alphabet to read English text. For isolated notes, it doesn't take too long to develop the mental associations required to correlate an up arrow to a forward movement of your leg. Reading denser sequences of notes will take longer, as you need to develop muscle memory that translates whole sequences of arrows into leg movements. This is the main barrier of entry to the higher difficulties of DDR (and any rhythm game, really); all you can do is **practice**.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're incurring [glossary:misses|miss] despite hitting the correct panel (temporal accuracy), you might need to work on internalizing the rhythm of the song, as discussed before. Remember that you should hit the arrows when they *completely overlap* with the corresponding receptor, not when the tip of the arrow touches the bottom of the receptor. If you're trying to push into harder levels, keep in mind that you'll start seeing notes that fall *between* the [glossary:beats|beat]. You can distinguish these notes more easily by changing your arrow color to NOTE from the [glossary:Option] menu; red arrows correspond to quarter notes, while blue notes are halfway between (8th notes). You can read more about note [glossary:quantization] in the glossary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're hitting the notes with low judgements like [glossary:Good] and [glossary:Great] (temporal precision), then you probably understand when you're supposed to hit the notes, but have trouble translating that information to precise muscle movements. Like everything in DDR, this is a skill best developed by copious amounts of **practice**. One thing you can do to accelerate your process is enable Slow/Late indicators from the [glossary:e-amusement] website; doing this will add an indicator near the judgements when you're stepping too soon or too late. However, this requires that you have not only an e-amusement account, but a [glossary:PASELI] subscription, costing about $3/month. If you're dedicated to improving your scores, you can follow [bemanistyle's guide on PASELI and the Basic Course subscription|https://www.bemanistyle.com/e-amusement-how-to-charging-paseli-and-basic-course-subscription/] that enables Slow/Late indicators.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid I mention that **practice** is the best way to improve and resolve mistakes? If there's one thing you take away from this article, it should be that practice makes perfect - or rather, [glossary:Marvelous]!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further reading\\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned before, we have an article on [navigating the DDR UI] if you've never touched DanceDanceRevolution A/A20 before.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should also read about [setting your speed], which will become important to improving your game much quicker than you might imagine.\"}")},53:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse("{\"data\":{\"title\":\"Deciding What to Play\",\"slug\":\"deciding-what-to-play\",\"description\":\"With over 800 songs to choose from, it can be daunting to pick them one at a time.\",\"sections\":[\"For fun\",\"For improvement\",\"For new content\",\"Miscellaneous ideas\",\"Further reading\"]},\"content\":\"Virtually every DDR player knows the experience of wandering aimlessly through song folders, looking for something, *anything* to play while the timer counts down its final seconds. With every new [glossary:mix] comes a wave of new songs, and after 17 mixes, decision paralysis on the music selection screen has never felt more real. A lot of the time, being able to decide on what to play requires you to ask yourself *why* you're playing in the first place. What *interests* you about DDR? In this article we'll look at various ways to pick a song to play, depending on your particular motivations.\\r\\n\\r\\n> #### In a Nutshell\\r\\n> Use different [glossary:categories|category] to narrow down your search for songs to play. If you have specific goals in mind, work towards them in whatever way makes the most sense for you; if you don't have goals, consider setting some for yourself! Use the Score Manager app to track your progress, and check out [LIFE4|https://life4ddr.com/] for some actionable goals for your skill level.\\r\\n\\r\\n## For fun\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where pretty much everyone starts, and if it works for you, great! Just play whatever you enjoy playing. But leaving it at that is sort of a cop-out - the question here becomes \u201chow do I *find* what I want to play?\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, **know how to use [glossary:categories|category]** to sort the songs into different kinds of folders. You can sort by [glossary:level], [glossary:mix], some genres, and much more using the various categories the game provides. Briefly hold the Left + Right buttons on the music selection screen to change your category, or just scroll through the folders until you find the categories between them. Even if you're not looking for a specific difficulty, sorting by levels and then browsing a level you're comfortable with will give you more viable songs to play than simply browsing by version folder. If you know you're into songs crossed over from a particular [glossary:Bemani] franchise (say, IIDX or pop'n music), there's a category for that. Or, if you prefer the classic DDR sound, try sorting by version and digging into the older DDR mixes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you haven't played many songs yet, you can easily find a song that you remember having enjoyed playing by choosing your own \\\"Clear Rank\\\" category, which sorts the songs by your high score. On the other hand, once you're deeper into the game, you could use the same Clear Rank category to find songs that you *haven't* played yet to give your [glossary:session] some more variety.\\r\\n\\r\\n## For improvement\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen meandering through the various categories gets old, you might benefit from playing songs for a *specific purpose* instead. Improving your skills usually falls into one of three categories: clearing harder charts, getting higher scores, and improving your overall game knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreaking into the higher levels of DDR is a matter of stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying songs that you're not certain you can pass. If you have an [glossary:e-amusement] card, there's very little penalty to failing a song - you're guaranteed to play all 3 stages, regardless of whether you [glossary:clear] them or not. However, if you're anticipating reaching the [glossary:Extra Stage], keep in mind that you must clear your [glossary:final stage] to be eligible for it. For this purpose, you can sort the songs by levels and try going a level or two above your comfort zone. You could also go into your Clear Rank category and try any charts that you've previously failed - you might be surprised at how quickly you're able to clear what once seemed impossible!\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting higher scores can mean improving the scores you've already obtained, or improving your ability to [glossary:sightread] new charts. Either way, using the Score Manager app (for [iOS|https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ddr-score-manager-a/id1100126073] or [Android|https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.linanfine.dsma]) is the most widely favored method for tracking your scores. Because the app uses the e-amusement website to load your scores, you'll need to purchase the e-amusement [glossary:Basic Course] to use it effectively. The app lets you sort and filter your scores in virtually any way you can imagine, so you can set your own goals and milestones, like raising all of your scores on a certain level over 900,000, or clearing every song in a folder.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloping a comprehensive knowledge of the game means broadening your horizons as much as possible. Some high-level players advocate for playing *every song in the game* as a long-term goal. Of course, you can break this goal up into smaller units of work, like fully clearing DDR mix folders from earliest to latest, or going through individual level folders according to your skill. Comprehensive goals are't for everyone, though, and playing over 800 songs would take *many* sessions of grinding to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider joining the [LIFE4 ranking system|https://life4ddr.com/], too! In their words, \u201cLIFE4 is a goal-oriented progression system designed to measure and push your comprehensive DDR ability.\u201d It's a great way to give your sessions a concrete purpose, with specific, actionable goals tailored for every skill level. It's also a fun and social way to measure your progress over time!\\r\\n\\r\\n## For new content\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're keeping up-to-date with the latest DDR events, your focus might be best placed on unlocking and playing the latest songs. The exact unlock mechanics tend to vary from event to event; bookmark [DDRCommunity.com|http://ddrcommunity.com/] to find guides for active in-game events. In general, though, most events make use of the [glossary:Extra Stage], and so knowing how to reach the Extra Stage in as few games as possible is important if you want to complete DDR events in an efficient manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two requirements for accessing the Extra Stage: you must have accumulated 9 [glossary:result stars|result star] and you must [glossary:clear] the [glossary:final stage]. You can only gain up to 3 result stars per song, so in order to maximize your Extra Stage playtime, it's ideal to collect all 3 result stars on every stage. To recap the glossary entry:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Clearing a stage with a [glossary:grade] of AAA awards 3 stars. Otherwise, clearing with a grade of AA- or higher awards 2 stars, and clearing with a grade of A+ or lower awards 1 star. Additionally, obtaining a [glossary:full combo] or playing on the [glossary:LIFE4] or [glossary:RISKY] gauge both award a bonus star, up to the maximum of 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, if you're able to consistently AAA or full combo songs, you should be able to access the Extra Stage without any problems. Otherwise, you could use the LIFE4 gauge to boost your stars, but this strategy carries the risk of failing the stage and losing out on all three stars. If you finish a game with fewer than 9 result stars, they'll carry over to your next game. However, any *excess* stars past the required 9 *won't* carry over, which is why it's significantly more efficient to aim for the full 3 stars on every stage. If this is important to you, you'll want to pick songs that you're confident you can either AAA, full combo, or LIFE4 clear (*with* the LIFE4 [glossary:option] enabled).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf AAAs and full combos are out of reach for you, don't sweat it too much. You'll still be able to access the Extra Stage, though probably not on every credit.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Miscellaneous ideas\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe you're just bored and want to have fun with the game without being paralyzed by indecision. We've all been there. Here are a few one-off ideas you can try during your next session:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Ask for song choice recommendations on social media.\\r\\n* Play the latest TAP Set of the Week from [The Arrow Panel|https://soundcloud.com/sfevolved], SF EVOLVED's podcast for dance games.\\r\\n* If you don't regularly play [glossary:doubles|DP], try out your favorite songs on double play.\\r\\n* Find some [glossary:rivals|rival] around your skill level and try to one-up their scores.\\r\\n* Try out the new [glossary:nonstop courses|course] on DDR A20.\\r\\n* Play one of the level 19 charts, just to see what it's like. (Don't hurt yourself, though!)\\r\\n* Try to clear [song:bag] on the lowest speed you can handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further reading\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was mentioned at the start, the process of deciding what to play depends heavily on *why* you play DDR in the first place. Check out our article titled \u201c[Why play DDR?|why play ddr]\u201d for an in-depth discussion of this topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the advice here boils down to knowing how to use the music selection UI to your advantage.
